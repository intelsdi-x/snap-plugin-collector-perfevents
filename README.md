# Snap collector plugin - Linux perf events

This plugin collects following hardware metrics for Cgroups from "perf" (Performance Counters for Linux) for [Snap Telemetry Framework](http://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap):
*  cycles
*  instructions
*  cache-references
*  cache-misses
*  branch-instructions
*  branch-misses
*  stalled-cycles-frontend
*  stalled-cycles-backend
*  ref-cycles

To see which of them are supported on your platform, please execute command `perf stat ls`.

## Getting Started

In order to use this plugin you need "perf" to be installed on a Linux target host.  

### System Requirements

- Linux (kernel 2.6.31+)
- root privileges
- "perf" installed on a host
- /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid set to 0 (in other case list of metrics can be limited)

### Installation

#### Download perfevents plugin binary:
You can get the pre-built binaries for your OS and architecture at plugins's [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-collector-perfevents/releases) page. Download the plugin from the latest release and load it into snapteld (`/opt/snap/plugins` is the default location for Snap packages).

#### To build the plugin binary:
Use https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-collector-perfevents or your fork as repo.

Clone repo into `$GOPATH/src/github.com/intelsdi-x/`:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/<yourGithubID>/snap-plugin-collector-perfevents.git
```

Build the plugin by running make within the cloned repo:
```
$ make
```
This builds the plugin in `./build/`

### Configuration and Usage

* Set up the [Snap framework](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/blob/master/README.md#getting-started)
* Load the plugin and create a task, see example in [Examples](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-collector-perfevents#examples).
 
## Documentation

To learn more about this plugin and Linux perf counters, visit:

* [Linux perf events wiki](https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page)
* [Snap perfevents unit test](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-collector-perfevents/blob/master/perfevents/perfevents_test.go)

### Collected Metrics
This plugin has the ability to gather the following metrics:

Namespace | Data Type |  Description
------------------|--------|-------------------------------
/intel/linux/perfevents/cgroup/cycles/[GROUP_NAME] | float64  | Total cycles. Be wary of what happens during CPU frequency scaling.
/intel/linux/perfevents/cgroup/instructions/[GROUP_NAME] | float64  | Retired instructions
/intel/linux/perfevents/cgroup/cache-references/[GROUP_NAME] | float64  | Cache accesses. Usually this indicates Last Level Cache accesses but this may vary depending on your CPU. This may include prefetches and coherency messages; again this depends on the design of your CPU.
/intel/linux/perfevents/cgroup/cache-misses/[GROUP_NAME] | float64  | Cache misses. Usually this indicates Last Level Cache misses; this is intended to be used in conjunction with the cache-references event to calculate cache miss rates.
/intel/linux/perfevents/cgroup/branch-instructions/[GROUP_NAME] | float64  | Retired branch instructions
/intel/linux/perfevents/cgroup/branch-misses/[GROUP_NAME] | float64  | Mispredicted branch instructions
/intel/linux/perfevents/cgroup/stalled-cycles-frontend/[GROUP_NAME] | float64  | Stalled cycles during issue
/intel/linux/perfevents/cgroup/stalled-cycles-backend/[GROUP_NAME] | float64  | Stalled cycles during retirement
/intel/linux/perfevents/cgroup/ref-cycles/[GROUP_NAME] | float64  | Total cycles; not affected by CPU frequency scaling

### Examples
Example running perfevents collector and writing data to a file.

Ensure [snap daemon is running](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap#running-snap):
* initd: `sudo service snap-telemetry start`
* systemd: `sudo systemctl start snap-telemetry`
* command line: `sudo snapteld -l 1 -t 0 &`

```

This data is published to a file `/tmp/published_perfevents` per task specification.

Notice, that if perf stat command returns:
 - **not counted**, the value of metric will be `nil`
 - **not supported**, the value of metric will be `<not supported>` and it will be omitted in the next cycle of collection

Stop task:
```
$ snaptel task stop 02dd7ff4-8106-47e9-8b86-70067cd0a850
Task stopped:
ID: 02dd7ff4-8106-47e9-8b86-70067cd0a850
```

### Using inside docker container
Plugin can collect perf events inside the docker container. To do that, it is needed to run container in privileged mode and mount host's cgroupfs.

#### Example docker run command for CentOS:
```bash
docker run -ti --privileged -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro centos:latest bash
```
**--privileged** is needed to allow collecting system-wide stats  
**-v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro** is needed for perf to be able to access host's cgroup hierarchy

Procfs is shared between host and docker container, so you can configure /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid once on host side (or from inside the privileged container, result will be the same).

#### Running on Kubernetes
To obtain the same result in Kubernetes, you need to configure your pods the same way:
- For running pod in privileged mode: https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/security-context/
- For mounting cgroupfs volume: https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/volumes/

#### Detecting which cgroup corresponds to current container
To obtain cgroup of container from inside of that container, you need to check /proc/self/cgroup file.

The file contains current container mountpoints for each subsystem and to retrieve current container's perf_event subsystem cgroup mountpoint, you can run such command:

```bash
cat /proc/self/cgroup | grep -oP "perf_event:/\K.*"
```

Example result:
```
docker/ae05db810861f060d1732f4ae508973782ac68ff60dff644c9ff4953eb437627
```
